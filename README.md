# Numerical Solutions for cubic kdv Boussineq Equations
Here we apply Kudryashov Method to the cubic kdv Boussineq Equations, as well as Optimal Homotopy Asymptotic Method (OHAM)
The final roots obtained after Kudryashov Method are provided below ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64677115/146309844-e9636a0d-354b-4f86-8507-a264fe3c685f.png)![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64677115/146309889-3f80af60-f1a7-4589-a946-5ffa3409667e.png)
